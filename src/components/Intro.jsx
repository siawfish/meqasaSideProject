                                            The government, through the Electricity Company of Ghana, will provide power, as is
                                            its obligation once there is a critical mass of homeowners

                                            Cleared and provision of accessible roads but with no concrete drains and tarmac.
                                            The expectation is that over time the government will complete the roads with
                                            tarmac.

                                            Residents will still benefit from the services within Appolonia City, such as nearby
                                            shops, medical facilities, schools and parks and open spaces.
